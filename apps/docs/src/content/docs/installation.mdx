description: Install and set up next-unified-query in your Next.js project
---

# Installation

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18 or higher**
- **React 18.3.1 or higher**
- **Next.js 13 or higher** (App Router supported)

## Package Installation

Install the main package which includes both core and React functionality:

```bash
npm install next-unified-query
```

```bash
pnpm add next-unified-query
```

```bash
yarn add next-unified-query
```

## What's Included

Next Unified Query comes with essential dependencies pre-bundled:

- **Zod v4** - Schema validation and type inference
- **es-toolkit** - High-performance utility functions
- **quick-lru** - Optimized LRU cache implementation

**Package Size**: ~119KB publish size (~6.6MB install size including Zod v4)

## TypeScript Support

The library is written in TypeScript and provides full type safety out of the box. No additional configuration is required.

## Verification

After installation, verify that the package is working correctly:

```typescript
import { QueryClient, setDefaultQueryClientOptions } from 'next-unified-query';

// Set global configuration
setDefaultQueryClientOptions({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 10000
});

// Create a query client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

console.log('next-unified-query is ready!');
```

## Import Paths

The library provides different import paths for different use cases:

```typescript
// Main exports (works in both server and client)
import { QueryClient, createQueryFactory, z } from 'next-unified-query';

// React-specific exports (client-side only)
import { useQuery, useMutation, QueryClientProvider } from 'next-unified-query/react';

// Core-only exports (if you need framework-agnostic features)
import { get, post, put, del } from 'next-unified-query';
```
